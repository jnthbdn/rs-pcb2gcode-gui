# Intro
[pcb2gcode](https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcode) is a great command-line tool, used to convert your gerber files into gcode for your milling machine. There's an (official) GUI for this tool called [pcb2gcodeGUI](https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcodeGUI), which is also pretty awesome.

> But why create another GUI?

Well, there's no real reason, I wanted to learn how to use the Rust GUI library [iced](https://iced.rs/). The ‚Äúreal‚Äù improvement is the ‚ÄúTool database‚Äù I've created to select the tool, instead of manually calculating the trace width. I'm also using the latest version of pcb2gcode without the deprecated options.
